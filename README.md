# Fuzebox
Fuzebox is an independent high-power 3D printed model rocket project designed to develop hands-on CAD skills and applied understanding of rocketry physics. It is designed to be small, lightweight, stable, and fast. It uses a tumble recovery system that takes advantage of its secure structure and aerodynamic features.

It has two models so far, P1 and P2, that will, or have been, launched and studied.
